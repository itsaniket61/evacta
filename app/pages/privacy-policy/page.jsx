        browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date and time stamp,
        referring/exit pages, and possibly the number of clicks. This data is
        not linked to any personally identifiable information. The purpose of
        collecting this information is for analyzing trends, administering the
        site, tracking users' movement on the website, and gathering demographic
        information.
